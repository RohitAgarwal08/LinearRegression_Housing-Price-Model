# LinearRegression_Housing-Price-Model

Problem statement : In this project, we are implementing linear regression with multiple variables to predict the price of a house. The file "data.txt" contains the training dataset of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.
